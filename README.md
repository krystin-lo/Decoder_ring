# Decoder Ring Project
The Decoder ring project is a combiniation of ceasar shift encoder, polyibius square, and substitution cypher. Requirements of the assignment were to write a series of unit tests using Mocha/ Chai and use different expect() methods to test your code. The overall project objectives were to implement testing and error handling work in JavaScript.
