# Decoder Ring Project
The Decoder ring project is a combiniation of ceasar shift encoder, polyibius square, and substitution cypher. Requirements of the assignment were to write a series of unit tests using Mocha/ Chai and use different expect() methods to test your code. The overall project objectives were to implement testing and error handling work in JavaScript.

## Ceasar Shift Encoder
Encryption with Caesar code is based on an alphabet shift (move of letters further in the alphabet), it is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, ie. a same letter is replaced with only one other (always the same for given cipher message). The most commonly used shift/offset is by 3 letters.

When encoding mark the encode circle, write down your choice of words, and put down the number of shifts you would like it encoded in.

## Polybius Square
The Polybius square, also known as the Polybius checkerboard, is a device invented by the ancient Greeks Cleoxenus and Democleitus, and made famous by the historian and scholar Polybius. The device is used for fractionating plaintext characters so that they can be represented by a smaller set of symbols, which is useful for telegraphy, steganography, and cryptography. The device was originally used for fire signalling, allowing for the coded transmission of any message, not just a finite amount of predetermined options as was the convention before.

## Substitution Cypher
The substitution cypher is a monoalphabetical substitution consisting in using a mixed alphabet (with the letters in an unusual order) and replacing the letters of the alphabet normal by it.
